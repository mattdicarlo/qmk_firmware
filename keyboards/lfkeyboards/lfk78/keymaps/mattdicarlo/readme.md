# Matt's LFK78 Hotswap Board

LFK78/68-HS Rev B PCB (at90usb646)

Mac OS modifiers, rearranged the default four-square block from the MF68, and customized the function layer.

Uses Grave/Esc on the Esc key so that Cmd+Esc works to cycle through application windows as if the Grave/Tilde key was in the usual place, and sets the `GRAVE_ESC_ALT_OVERRIDE` flag so that Cmd-Opt-Esc still opens the Force Quit menu.


LED colors are based off of Hyperfuse colors, translating from SP color chip codes to RGB
